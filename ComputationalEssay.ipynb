    "The purpose of our project is to examine the New York Times coverage of various world conflicts in which the US had been involved with, either militarily or diplomatically. The inspiration for this focus comes from the role of the New York Times in the Iraq War in 2003, which includes publicizing faulty information and swaying public perception in favor of US intervention.\n",
    "For this project, we focused on the following three countries and time periods\n",
    "- Chile (01/1960 to 01/1990)\n",
    "- Libya (01/2008 to 01/2013)\n",
    "- Bolivia (01/2018 to 01/2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "for the purpose of answering \"How does the quantity and quality of the New York Times media coverage vary around regime changes around the world?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, this question can be broken down into three narrower fields of focus:\n",
    "- How frequently does the New York Times mention a country per month in the time period surrounding regime changes?\n",
    "- What words are most used in headlines about these countries during this time period?\n",
    "- How do the headlines' sentiment correlate with specific regimes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach to providing an answer to these questions can be broken down into several stages including data collection, sentiment analysis, and effective communication of our findings. We utilized the New York Times Article Search API to obtain the data (in the form of article headlines), and Google Cloud's Natural Language API to analyze the text of the headlines. More detail on how exactly this was done will be provided in the Methodology section below. We also used Python's data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Numpy, and Wordcloud to create informative and effective graphics displaying the data and subsequent analysis."

    "The first step that we took towards answering our question was to obtain data from the [New York Times (NYT) Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview). The format of the requests is such that the base URI (`https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q={query}&fq={filter}&api-key={yourkey}`) can be edited and altered to fit the desired search. We used this format as follows:\n",

    "using the target country in place of `{search_term}` and the start and end dates in format YYYYMMDD in place of `{begin_date}` and `{end_date}`.\n",

    "From the response provided by the API we focused on the hits, which is the number of articles in which the search term is mentioned, and the headlines, on which we conducted sentiment anaylsis. Because the time span of our focus on each country spans at least 3 years, we grouped the hits and headlines by month when saving data.\n",

    "The data that we've collected on NYT media coverage for Chile, Libya, and Bolivia takes the form of hits, headlines, and sentiment analysis per month around the time period of a regime change and/or US military involvement in these countries. The number of hits can be used to gauge media attention, under the assumption that more hits means more media coverage by the NYT. We decided to visualize this data using a scatterplot of hits vs. time in order to get a sense of when each country was mentioned the most; our hypothesis that there should be spikes in hits around notable events can be verified with this plot. Because the data is already stored in an organized fashion, we used the Matplotlib library to create the scatterplot of the `Number of Hits` column vs. the `MM-YYYY` column from the csv file for each country.\n",

    "To determine the kind of language that was most frequently used by the NYT to describe each country, we used Python's Wordcloud library to create a qualitative display of most common words. The more prominent words in the wordcloud should be a good indicator of how the NYT is describing the country around and during military/politcal conflict. We have the capability to create wordclouds for single, isolated months, which allows us to visualize headlines directly corresponding to large hit values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a more quantitative understanding of the headline language, our third visualization of the data is a bubblechart that plots the sentiment score vs. time, with the size of the bubble corresponding to the number of hits. Once again, this data is plotted using Matplotlib's scatter function to plot the `Sentiment Score (-1 to 1)` column against the `MM-YYYY` column of each csv, controlling the size with the `Number of Hits`. This provides a comprehensive visual of both media attention and sentiment, allowing us to see big-picture trends that the wordcloud or the scatterplot can't do individually."
